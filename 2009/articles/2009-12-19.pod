Title:   Restoring The Traditions of our Forefathers
Package: Git::Fingerd

=head1 The War on "Finger"

I'll admit it:  I am a traditionalist.  I believe in honoring the protocols
that were left to us by our forefathers.  Maybe that makes me "old-fashioned"
or "short sighted" or "terminally irrelevant," but I see no reason I should
have to abandon technologies that have existed for 30 years just because they
are "horrible" and "obsolete" and "full of security holes."  What does HTTP
really give us over Gopher?  Why should I use BitTorrent instead of FTP?  How
is Wave any better than L<Ytalk|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ytalk>?

...and then there's L<finger|http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc742.html>.  People try
to replace finger more than anything else.  First "the home page" and then
"MySpace" and "Classmates" and now I think the hot new thing is "Orkut."  Well,
the F<.plan> file will live forever in my heart.

I wanted to provide a suitable tribute to my favorite ancient protocol, and
what better way than to pair it up with one of the trendy technologies that I
I<do> enjoy.  L<Git|http://git-scm.com/> might only be relevant for a short
while, but it's giving us all kinds of good ideas to backport to
L<Arch|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_arch>.

=head1 Finger My Git

L<Git::Fingerd> is a L<Net::Finger::Server>-powered repository information
delivery platform that allows you to easily access information about a server's
git repositories from any finger-enabled operating system like Mac OS X.
Here you can see the result of fingering one of my git servers:

  ~$ finger @git.codesimply.com
  [zodiac.codesimply.com]

If I want to learn more about a repository, it's easy:

  Rx is really cool, yadda yadda, whatever...

=head1 The Future!

As time goes on, we can forwardport more ancient protocols into the future,
making sure that the future is just as technologically advanced as the past!
Imagine using L<Net::GitHub> and
L<Gopher::Server|https://metacpan.org/release/Gopher-Server> to create a Gopher
interface to L<Github|http://github.com/>!  C<git push> via UUCP, or C<git
clone> across telnet!  The future will be so bright that we'll have to wear
Wayfarers.
