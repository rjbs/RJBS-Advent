=head1 Beyond Hex and Octal

It's sort of easy to convert between decimal, hexadecimal, and octal in Perl.
C<sprintf> can produce decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary digit strings,
and the C<oct> built-in can read those strings back into numbers.  For example,
to convert from hex to binary strings, we might do the following:

  #!perl
  my $hex = '99';
  my $num = oct("0x$hex"); # or we could use hex($hex);
  my $bin = sprintf '%b', $num; # ...and we get 10011001

This is a little inconsistent, but fast and easy.  Unfortunately, sometimes we
need to work with really weird digit sets.  Fortunately, L<Number::Nary> makes
these really easy to work with.  For example, if we need to convert from
sexagesimal to trinary (presumably because we are writing a Star Trek script)
we can just create routines using Number::Nary like this:

  #!perl
  use Number::Nary
    -codec_pair => {
      -suffix => '_3',
      digits  => '012',
    },
    -codec_pair => {
      -suffix => '_60',
      digits  => [ map { sprintf '%02u', $_ } (0 .. 59) ], # 00 through 59
    };

Now we have four routines for converting between our numbering systems.  Given
the number 102012012 in trinary, we can easily convert it to sexagesimal:

  #!perl
  my $trinary = '102012012';
  my $number  = decode_3($trinary);
  my $sexa    = encode_60($number); # "021559"

Neat, but is it ever practical?  Yes!  For one thing, it can be used to fix
numbers into weird character sets.  I've used it to cram several large numbers
into email addresses by using the valid email address characters as a digit
set.  There's also Jesse Vincent's L<Number::RecordLocator>, which "encodes
integers into a short and easy to read and pronounce locator strings." Using
Number::Nary, we can re-implement that module in about four lines:

  #!perl
  use Number::Nary -codec_pair => {
    digits    => [  2 .. 9, 'A', 'C' .. 'R', 'T' .. 'Z' ],
    predecode => sub { my $s = $_[0]; $s =~ tr/01SBsb/OIFPFP/; return $s },
  };

  # We silently replace some digits with others to keep things easy to read.
  ok(decode('1234') == decode('I234')); # 513430
  ok(decode('10SB') == decode('IOFP')); # 491554

Number::Nary is slower than C<sprintf> and C<oct> are, but since they can only
handle a few different digit sets, they're not always going to solve the
problem at hand.  Having Number::Nary in the wings when you need it can be a
real time-saver.

Finally, here's a quick bit of Christmas spirit:

  #!perl
  use Number::Nary 0.107 -codec_pair => {
    digits => [ 'ho ' ],
    postencode => sub {
      (my $s = shift) =~ s/ \z//;
      "Merry Christmas, $s!"
    },
    predecode  => sub {
      my $s = lc shift;
      $s =~ s/\Amerry christmas, //;
      $s =~ s/!\z/ /;
      $s;
    },
  };

  # Appropriate:
  say encode(3);

  # Not:
  say encode(1);
